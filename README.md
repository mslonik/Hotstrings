# How to install

## 1. Recommended: installer file (*HotstringsInstaller.exe*). 
 
Just download this file from this repository and run it. 

Caveat: many anti-virus software may warn you about virus threat or threat related to installation of software from unknown source.
Advantage: installer installs not only *Hotstrings* application, but also set of *libraries* and other files (license, icon, etc.).

- Installer can be run in silent mode. To do so run it from command line wit */S* switch (capital letter is mandatory).
- Default location of all the files: *c:\users\<user>\AppData\Local\Hotstrings*.
- Installer source code is available [here](https://github.com/mslonik/Hotstrings-NSIS_installer).

<br />

## 2. Script (*Hotstrings.ahk*)

Just download this file. To run it you will need so called AutoHotkey interpreter. You can easily install it as standalone application. Just visit the [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) webpage, download and install it. 

Advantages:
- You will be able to run any *AutoHotkey* script, not only *Hotstrings*.
- No virus warnings.
- Full access to source code (happy hacking!).

The script is prepared to create / prepare all necessary files and folders upon the first run. I strongly recommend you to install it in default folder (*c:\users\<user>\AppData\Local\Hotstrings*).

Caveat: *Libraries* are not installed by script itself. You will need to download them manually from [here](https://github.com/mslonik/Hotstrings-Libraries) or from application menu.

<br />

## 3. Executable (*Hotstrings.exe*)

Just download and run this file.

Caveat: many anti-virus software may warn you about virus threat or threat related to installation of software from unknown source.

Advantage: 
- You don't need to install any other executable, as the *AutoHotkey* interpreter is bundled with script in this executable.
- The executable will create / prepare all necessary files and folders upon the first run. I strongly recommend you to install it in default folder (*c:\users\<user>\AppData\Local\Hotstrings*).
