# *Hotstrings* application
Written in [AutoHotkey][] application *Hotstrings*  with many useful features:
- quick text replacement aka hotstrings; 
    
    *short alphanumeric strings (aka triggerstrings) are used to automatically replace long alphanumeric strings (aka hotstrings)*;
- defined hotstrings are operating system wide;

    *it means that can be triggered in any text / edit window, in any application*;
- GUI (Graphical User Interface); 

    *for easy definition and/or edition of hotstrings*;
- clipboard ready;

    *useful especially for long text strings, as it enables entering the long hotstring in a blink of an eye*;
- one triggering abbreviation can call several different text strings of your choice;

    *chosen from menu*;
- graphical overview of existing hotstrings with search capabilities;
- definitions of hotstrings are stored in .csv files, as many, as you like; 

    *each file can contain hotstring belonging to specific category, e.g. emojis, physical symbols, first and second names etc.*;
- undoing of hotstrings;

    *conversion of last entered hotstring again into triggering abbreviation*;
- runs on Microsoft Windows family operating systems;
- written in AutoHotkey script language but does not require this language interpreter to be installed and can be run standalone thanks to .exe file;

    *nevertheless installation of [AutoHotkey][] is greatly adviced)*

# What are the hotstrings (absolute beginner quide)
There are two corresponding notions:
- triggerstring,
- hotstring.

The relationship between these two notions can be presented as follows:

**triggerstring** → **hotstring**

So the triggerstring triggers the corresponding hotstring. 

Wording convention: usually the corresponding pair of alphanumeric strings *(triggestring, hotstring)* is also called as *hotstring*. When it comes to confusing, both of them will be differentiated.

# How the AutoHotkey and hotstrings work
The AutoHotkey: 
* keeps in memory the pairs (triggerstring, hotstring) 
and 
* applies the hotstring recognizer which filters the input stream of keys pressed by the user, searching for the triggestrings. 

If the triggestring is recognized: 
* the hostring is issued,
* the hotstring recognizer is reset.

The concept and usage of hotstrings is based and compatible to AutoHotkey [hotstring][] notion.

# Why somobody may want to use hotstrings?
Because they can significantly make life easier and... longer? 

* The triggestring can be short. Opposite to that the hotstring can be long in comparison to triggestring. As a consequence one can save some time when uses hotstrings.
---
*Example:* 
triggerstring | hotstring
---|---
title1 | This is very long title of technical document with lots of numeric data which are hard to remember EN 982182 : 12 and is reference in a few places in your newly edited document

---

* The triggerstring can be used to trigger special symbols / letters / emoji, which are not present on a keyboard. Then it can happen that the triggerstring could be longer than actual hotstring.
---
*Example:* 
triggerstring | hotstring
---|---
elephant/ | 🐘

---

* To correct / auto correct spelling of words or enter unique letters
---
*Example:*
triggerstring | hotstring
---|---
email | e-mail


* Nowadays we still frequently use keyboard as input device to so called personal computer. This computer is not so "personal" as you can't easily define system wide (working in any application) triggering your personal hotstrings. 

---
*Example: *
triggerstring | hotstring
---|---
fs@ | `FirstName.SecondName@yourhosting.com`


So let's make your PC really personal again. Now with use of hotstrings and Hotstring application.

# Why somebody may want to use *Hotstring* application?
Because it doesn't require much knowledege and text editing to run your own hotstrings. It can be run even without installation. Thanks to GUI (Graphical User Interface) you will master defining and applying of your own hotstrings in blink of an eye.

# Let's begin by defining of few first hotstrings
At first please observe the main window again. In order to define any hotstring one have to follow top down the screen (in blue):
- Enter triggerstring
- Select trigger option(s)
- Select hotstring output function
- Enter hotstring
- Select hotstring library
- Set the hotstring

![Defining of hotstring][]

We will start by defining of *by the way* hotsring with plain *btw* triggerstring and no options.

## Enter triggestring
Let's put in this text edit field some text: 

![Enter triggerstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_EnterTriggerstring.png)

Please keep in mind that this edit window does not show space key, as it is blank key. But in this tutorial it will be easier to see what we're doing by using the ☐ convention from now on to show the Space (Spacebar key). So now let's put there:
```
btw
```
![Enter triggerstring, example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_EnterTriggerstring_btw.png)


## Select trigger option(s)
![Default trigger option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SelectTriggerOption.png) 

By default no option is set (option string is empty). Then after triggerstring is entered, additionally one *trigger key* have to be pressed by user in order to trigger the hotstring.

The *trigger key* is defined as one of the following keys: -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!\`n☐\`t (note that \`n is Enter,  \`t is Tab, and there is a plain space between \`n and \`t marked as ☐ according to our convention). 

Let's leave no option set and continue.

## Select hotstring output function
![Select hotstring output function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SelectHostringOutputFunction.png)

Select one and only one option from the list. By default *Send by AutoHotkey* is set. It means that the hotstring will be output by AutoHotkey, without menu and not by Clipboard. More about *output functions* later on.

Let's leave it.

## Enter hotstring
![Enter hotstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_EnterHotsring.png)

Let's do that:
```
by the way
```
![Enter hotstring, example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Example_ByTheWay.png)


## Select hotstring library
![Select hotstring library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SelectHostringLibrary.png) 

This list contains all and only *.csv files from withing folder ..\Hotstrings3\Categories. One can have as many files (even empty!) as necessary.

Let's select the AutocorrectionHotstring.csv for sake of example.
![Select hotstring library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Example_HotstringLibrary.png)

## Set the hotstring
Select / click the *Set hostring* button. The function and meaning of two others is hopefully quite obvious. It will be explained in details later on.

![Set the hotstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_HostringButtons.png) 

## Congratulations!
You've defined your first hotstring. Have a look now into the left part of the main screen, into the *Library content*. Find there your newly defined hotstring:

![Library content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Example_LibraryContent.png)

---
---
---

# Now let's dive into more detailed description of available functions
After installation just double click on the Hotstrings icon (capital letter *H* as *Hotstrings* on green background) in system tray:
![Example of system tray](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SystemTray.png) 
or... use hotkey *Ctrl + # + h* (Control + Windows key + h).

Next you'll see main GUI (Graphical User Interface) window which enable you to edit hotstrings:

### Main window of *Hotstring* application

![Main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_MainWindow.png)

The main window can be divided into the following parts:
- menu [1],
- hotstring definition / edition [2],
- Display of existing hotstrings [3].

![Main window parts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_MainWindow2.png)


### Trigger options
Variants of triggering are controlled by the options:

![Select trigger option(s)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SelectTriggerOption.png)

* Immediate Execute (*)
* No Backspace (B0)
* No End Char (O)
* Case Sensitive `(C)`
* Inside Word (?)
* Disable

Concurrently all / none of above options can be set.

#### Default (no trigger option selected)
![Default trigger option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_SelectTriggerOption.png) 

By default for new hotstrings no option is set. Then after triggerstring additionally one trigger key have to be pressed by user in order to trigger the hotstring.

option | triggestring | trigger      | hotstring
---|---|---|---
|       | alphanumeric string  | -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!\`n☐\`t | alphanumeric string

The trigger key is defined as any of the following keys -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!\`n☐\`t (note that \`n is Enter, \`t is Tab, and there is a plain space between \`n and \`t marked as ☐). 

At the moment *Hotstrings* application does not allow to change the set of trigger keys. 

#### Immediate Execute (\*)
![Trigger option Immediate Execute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Option_ImmediateExecute.png) 

The option (\*) is called "immediate execute" is entering of the last character of triggerstring immediately executes exchange of the triggerstring with the hotstring. Another words: triggerstring is erased (backspaced) and hotstring is placed there.

option | triggestring | trigger      | hotstring
---|---|---|---
|       | alphanumeric string  | last character of triggerstring | alphanumeric string



**triggerstring** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↑

then the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**last character of that string is a trigger**


---
*Example of triggerstring and hotstring definition*
option | triggerstring     | trigger: last character  | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
\*     | btw/              | /                         | by☐the☐way

![Example, immediate execute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Example_ImmediateExecute.png) 


*Example, execution*
content stream |    triggerstring + trigger| replaced by hotstring
---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------
Something,☐something☐ | ~~btw/~~ | by☐the☐way
> Something,☐something☐ ~~btw/~~ by☐the☐way

Comment: triggerstring is erased, what is shown by ~~strikethrough~~.

---

#### No Backspace (B0)
![Trigger option No Backspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Option_NoBackspace.png) 

By default the **hotstring** replaces the **triggestring**, what was shown in the above examples by ~~strikethrough~~ from the content stream the **triggerstring**. When (B0) option is applied, the **triggestring** is not replaced (no BackSpace) by the **hotstring** but is followed by the **hotstring**.

option | triggestring | trigger      | hotstring
---|---|---|---
B0       | alphanumeric string  | -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!\`n☐\`t  | alphanumeric string

---
*Example of triggerstring and hotstring definition*

![Example, no Backspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mslonik/Hotstrings/master/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_Example_NoBackspace.png) 

*Example, execution*
content stream |    triggerstring + trigger| replaced by hotstring
---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------
Something,☐something☐ | btw. | by☐the☐way.

> Something,☐something☐btw.by☐the☐way.


---
*Example of useful B0 hotstring*
The B0 option is useful for example to define HTML tags. In the following example the sequence {left☐5} is used to move to the left (back) cursor after he sequence </em> is entered.

option | triggerstring     | trigger: last character   | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
\*B0    | <em>              | >                         | </em>{left☐5}

*Example, execution*
content stream |    triggerstring + trigger  | replaced by hotstring
---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------
Something,☐something☐| <em> | </em>

> Something,☐something☐<em>|</em>

Comment:

#### No End Char (O)

#### Case Sensitive `(C)`

#### Inside Word (?)

#### Disable

## Overlapping hotstrings
One of the useful options (...) are overlapping hotstrings.

---
*Example 1 of overlapping triggerstrings*
The triggestrings of the two following examples overlap, but the first one is shorther, then the second one.

option | triggerstring     | trigger:    | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
|    | btw               | -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!\`n☐\`t  | by the way
\*    | btw2              | 2                         | back to work

*Example, execution*
content stream |    triggerstring + trigger replaced by | hotstring
---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------
Something,☐something☐| btw☐ | by☐the☐way☐


> Something,☐something☐ ~~btw☐~~ by☐the☐way☐

The second hotstring will never be triggered, as always after triggering of the first triggestring (btw) the triggerstring is reset. The solutions to this issue are shown in the following examples.


---
*Example 2 of overlapping triggerstrings*
The triggestrings of the two following examples overlap, but this time both of them are of the same length.
option | triggerstring     | trigger: last character   | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
\*    | btw1               | 1                     | by the way
\*    | btw2              | 2                         | back to work

*Example, execution*
content stream |    triggerstring + trigger replaced by | hotstring
---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------
Something,☐something☐ | btw1 | by☐the☐way
☐ | btw2 | back☐to☐work

> Something,☐something☐ ~~btw1~~ by☐the☐way☐ ~~btw2~~ back☐to☐work


---
*Example 3 of overlapping triggerstrings*
The space itself can be a part of triggestring as well. What's is important is the length of the triggerstrings. This can be useful to distinguish the abbreviation from its phrase, as in the following example.
option | triggerstring     | trigger: last character   | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
\*    | api☐               | ☐                     | API
\*    | api/              | /                         | Application☐Programming☐Interface

---
*Example 4 of overlapping triggerstrings, special feature of Hotstring application: menu*
Thanks to Hotstrings application the one triggestring can be used to trigger menu with defined list of hotstrings. The different options are separated by "|" mark. The first option on the list is the default one. Selection of the option is made by pressing the Enter key. Cauion, it doesn't work with mouse clicks.
option | triggerstring     | trigger: last character   | hotstring
-------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------
\* and menu    | api/              | /                         | API *| Application☐Programming☐Interface


---




## Hotstring menu
![Main menu](/HelpPictures/Hotstring3_MainMenu.png)
- Monitor
- Search Hotstrings
- Delay
- Help
- About

In order to access menu by keyboard just press the left Alt key.

### Monitor
Enable choice of the monitor where main GUI window is shown. If GUI window is closed, application continues to run (system tray icon is still accessible). When GUI window is called again (by pressing the hotkey or by clicking with mouse) it will be displayed at monitor of your choice.

### Search Hotstrings
Enable searching of hotstring in any of the categories. All .csv files (category files) are searched. This option is helpful e.g. to find duplicates of hotstrings.

### Delay
Enable change of the delay between copying of the hotstring from clipboard to specific text window from which it was triggered.
By default equal to 200 ms. Maximum value equal to 500 ms (0.5 s).

**Tip:** Sometimes when long hotstrings are triggered and clipboard is applied to immediately enter it, strange behaviour can occurre. Instead of expected hotstring the previous content of clipboard may appear. The reason is that operating system can not gurantee the time to insert the content of clipboard into specific window / editing field. In order to support operating system enlarge the delay. The shorter the delay than better, but if too short, mentioned behaviour can be observed.

 # Undoing of the last hotsring
 The last hotstring can be easily undone by pressing Cltr + z hotkey or Ctrl + Backspace. 
 
 **Caution:** In some applications the same hotkeys are used for undoing the last action. Then the overall result sometimes is unpredictable or unwanted. In case of some trouble use undoing hotstring several times in a raw.
